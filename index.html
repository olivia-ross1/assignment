      <h2>Fashion Retail and the Coronavirus Pandemic:</h2><h2> The Impact of a Year of Restrictions</h2>
      <p>When the first UK lockdown was announced over a year ago, all ‘non-essential’ retail was forced to abandon their stock and pull down their shutters in an almost apocalyptic style of events. Streets and cities fell quiet as everyone hid indoors. Cautious of one another. Scared to get too close. Only daring to venture outside for a daily walk, or if they were brave enough, for the weekly shop.</p>
      <p>Yet, while mask, sanitise and social distance is the three-step survival guide that has allowed supermarkets to keep their doors open throughout the pandemic, clothing stores have struggled to survive using this guide alone.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, clothing and department stores have been closed for the duration of three national lockdowns, amounting to around six months of severe measures in which they have been unable to conduct business. For the six months they have been open, these stores have adhered to the three-steps for survival: customer service smiles have been replaced by the eye scrunch of masked faces, sanitiser stations have been installed in every doorway, and security guards have policed entrances, limiting the number of people in-store.</p>
      <p>However, in following these steps so closely, the well-loved, bustling shopping experience has been sacrificed. The previous ease and excitement of weaving in and out of stores now complicated by the rules, and the once full-of-life environment a lot weaker than it was before.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, these circumstances have caused clothing sales to decrease dramatically. <a href="https://www.drapersonline.com/insight/analysis/coronavirus-one-year-on">In 2020, sales fell by 25.1%,</a> making fashion the retail sector that was the worst affected by the UK’s coronavirus restrictions.</p>
      <p>When compared with other retailers, fashion’s position is clear, as while all retail has generally suffered decreased turnovers over the last year, clothing and department stores have been hit the hardest. 81.8% of clothing companies and 100% of department stores reported a decrease in monthly profits in January 2021, representing the only two sectors that did not see any increase in profits.</p>

    </div>

      <p>With fashion retailers teetering on a ledge, struggling to generate their usual stable income, the survival of clothing and department stores is not inevitable, as with every increased restriction and every lockdown, fashion retail is pushed closer to the point of a closing sale.</p>
      <p>This fatal impact was already hinted at in 2020 when retail titan, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-asos-buys-topshop-265million-23419628">Topshop, was forced to permanently close its doors</a> and move its business online after struggling to make a profit, and ultimately being bought out by the online goliath, ASOS, for £295 million.</p>
      <p>This represents the trend of the coronavirus pandemic: fashion retailers moving online to cater to the isolated shopper who has become a digital consumer. The current shopping experience now increasingly characterised by filtering through nice tops and comfy trousers, to then stare at the door in anticipation as soon as a dispatch email is sent.</p>
      <p>Consumer behaviour has changed massively over the last year, with online sales for non-food stores, including clothing and department stores, fluctuating with the intensity of restrictions. In 2020, online sales rose from 15% in January to 46.2% in April, before rising again in 2021 to 39.4%.</p>

    <div class="graph">
      <iframe title="Proportion of Sales Occurring Online (in percent)" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-A9e7b" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/A9e7b/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();

      <p>Online retail is yet to reach the lows it was experiencing pre-pandemic and has instead reached a record proportion of total sales, making up 35.2% of all retail in January 2021, compared with 19.5% the previous year.</p>
      <p>In line with this change, online fashion retailers are now experiencing increased traffic since shoppers are turning to outlets that were not their usual first choice for fashion pre-pandemic. <a href="https://www.drapersonline.com/news/boohoo-enjoys-strong-christmas-trade">Sales for the Boohoo Group</a> rose by 40% in the last four months of 2020, while <a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-9144093/Discounters-Just-Eat-deliver-virus-wreaks-havoc-High-Street.html">sales at ASOS</a> increased by 36%.</p>
      <p>Traditionally in-store retailers have also experienced this change in consumer behaviour. John Lewis, who had previously gained the majority of their sales from their stores, saw their <a href="https://www.chargedretail.co.uk/2020/12/22/online-purchases-now-account-for-up-to-70-of-john-lewis-sales/">online sales rise</a> from 40% in March 2020 to 70% in December.</p>
      <p>With fashion retail now becoming a digital world, there is no doubt that the pandemic has accelerated and increased the dominance of online retailers. The ease and practicality of browsing and buying clothes online is now far too difficult for high street stores to compete with.</p>
      <p>With ease at the centre of online retail’s appeal, it is unlikely that the high street will ever be the same again. Abandoned units will be where shoppers’ favourite stores used to, and in-store retailers will have to offer something unique to bait customers away from the convenience of their laptops. If they do not, the classic character of the UK’s high street may be killed off for good, in favour of a more youthful face, who will bring in the business that the industry needs.</p>

      <h2>Buchanan Street Then and Now:</h2><h2> 100 Years of Glasgow’s ‘Style Mile’</h2>
    <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="444" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=a42f16a4-917a-11eb-83c8-ebb5d6f907df"></iframe>
    <p>Between the proudly standing buildings of Glasgow’s past, people flood Buchanan Street from all directions. Colourful plastic bags swinging from their arms as their chatter fills the air. These conversations accompanied by the <span class="soundcite" data-id="1023192541" data-start="10788" data-end="26000" data-plays="1">buskers</span> who sing songs from the radio, covering them so well that many can’t help but crowd round them to watch. It may be a busy place. One that is rarely graced by sunlight, but still people come from all over Scotland hoping to scout out their next purchase.</p>
    <p>With so much to offer culturally and commercially, it is no wonder this is the Buchanan Street that all Scots know and love. The central artery of Glasgow’s ‘style mile’ that for many years has allowed people to access iconic Scottish born stores like House of Fraser, whilst also experiencing the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-50316325">creativity that Glasgow has become known for.</a> As many Scots know, a day shopping in Buchanan Street would not be complete without watching the street performers who provide the soundtrack to the city.
    <p>It is this distinct identity that makes it difficult to imagine Buchanan Street in any other form. Yet, this vibrant and bustling version is literally worlds apart from its early 20th century self, as over 100 years ago, Glasgow’s shopping district was only in its infancy.</p>
    <p>Despite much of the period’s architecture remaining, simply having been updated with metal sculptural embellishments, the shops that make up Buchanan Street have modernised alongside the consumer.</p>
    <p>In 1912, the entry to Buchanan Street from St. Enoch’s Square was flanked by jewellers. H. Samuel’s took up the ground floor of the Arthur & Fraser building on the left, and jewellers Robert Scott and Robert Stewart conducted business in the former mansion on the right. All three were a sign of the high-class tone of Buchanan Street in the early 20th century, with Stewart’s shop being particularly upmarket since it offered Glaswegians the opportunity to buy from former monarch, Queen Victoria’s appointed goldsmith, silversmith and jeweller.</p>
    <p>Since then, Buchanan Street has made way for contemporary fashion retailers who now dominate much of the street with their vibrant and enticing window displays. Their faceless mannequins decorated in the colourful patterns and styles of the season, modelling each outfit to those who meander by. Tempting them inside with an endless amount of ‘must haves’ and a range of low price tags.</p>
    <p>The variety, quantity and affordability of fashion is now so much better than it was 100 years ago, when many wore the same style, as the street’s shopping experience has become more inclusive since the early 20th century.</p>
    <p>Well into the 1920s, ‘going into town’ simply to shop was an adventure that many Scots rarely undertook or could afford. So while the street was often bustling for the times, with horses <span class="soundcite" data-id="1016697784" data-start="5765" data-end="10921" data-plays="1">trotting</span> around pedestrians on the road, it was nowhere near as busy as what Scots would now class as a normal Saturday afternoon, when a continuous wave of people can usually be found wandering down the street.</p>
    <p>However, when 20th century transport links improved and Scottish incomes generally increased, Buchanan Street underwent a significant transformation, becoming a place for the many rather than the few. Shopping centres were built at the head and the feet of the street and the road was pedestrianised to make way for the thousands of people who shopped there.</p>
    <p>Having recently been named as one of the <a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/glasgows-buchanan-street-named-worlds-19558153">world’s best pedestrianised streets,</a> the ability to walk and shop freely is a big part of why Buchanan Street is so loved today. It caters to the people and keeps them at the centre of the shopping experience. After all, it’s the people that make the street what it is. As the bold pink signs always say, ‘People Make Glasgow.’</p>
    <p>Buchanan Street has lived through so much history since its earlier days as a high-class haven, but it still has so much more that it wants to give. It wants to continue keeping people at the centre of its experience and it wants people to keep making Glasgow. As long as they remember to keep showing up, Buchanan Street will never truly change. It is only when the floods of people turn to a trickle that the street will fall quiet and the vibrant Buchanan Street that Scots know today will fade into the past, becoming a well-loved part of Glasgow’s history.</p>
