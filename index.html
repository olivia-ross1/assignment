      <h2>Buchanan Street Then and Now</h2>
    <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="444" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=a42f16a4-917a-11eb-83c8-ebb5d6f907df"></iframe>
      <p>Between the proudly standing buildings of Glasgow’s past, people flood Buchanan Street from all directions. Colourful plastic bags swinging from their arms as chatter fills the air. These conversations accompanied by the<span class="soundcite" data-id="1018394389" data-start="23290" data-end="33000" data-plays="1">buskers</span>who sing songs from the radio, covering them so well that many can’t help but crowd round them to watch. It may be a busy place. One that is rarely graced by sunlight, but still people come from all over Scotland just to meander along the smooth stoned street, hoping to scout out their next purchase.</p>
      <p>With so much to offer culturally and commercially, and being situated within the city that was voted one of the friendliest in the world, it is no wonder that Buchanan Street has become the central artery of Glasgow’s style mile. A vital part of what is now the second largest retail centre in the UK. Offering access to iconic Scottish born stores like House of Fraser, whilst also catering to the contemporary shopper with global brands like Apple and Nike.</p>
      <p>It is this distinct identity that makes it difficult to imagine Buchanan Street in any other form. Yet, the street we know and love today is strides apart from its early 20th century self. While much of the historic architecture remains, merely having been updated slightly with metal sculptural embellishments, the shops that take up these premises have modernised alongside the consumer.</p>
      <p>In 1912, the entry to Buchanan Street from St. Enoch’s Square was flanked by jewellers. H. Samuel taking up the ground floor of the Arthur & Fraser building on the left corner, and jewellers Robert Scott and Robert Stewart conducting business in the former mansion on the right. All three were a sign of the high-class tone of Buchanan Street in the early 20th century, with Stewart’s premises being particularly upmarket since it offered Glaswegians the opportunity to buy former monarch, Queen Victoria’s appointed goldsmith, silversmith and jeweller.</p>
      <p>Since then, Buchanan Street has made way for contemporary fashion retailers who now dominate much of the street with their vibrant and enticing window displays. Their faceless mannequins decorated in the mass-produced styles of the seasons, encouraging people to buy into the low cost of fashion trends. The variety and quantity of clothes available to the modern Scottish shopper unmatched by the early 20th century, where many people opted to wear the same style. The diversity of fashion only arising when the exclusivity of Glasgow’s style mile significantly reduced.</p>
      <p>Well into 1920s, going to the centre of Glasgow simply to shop was an adventure that many Scots rarely undertook, or could even afford. So, the general increase in incomes and decrease in wealth disparities since then has allowed the street to transform into a place for the many, rather than the few.</p>
      <p>This is perhaps best reflected in the pedestrianisation of the street, as where <span class="soundcite" data-id="1016697784" data-start="5765" data-end="10921" data-plays="1">horses once trotted,</span>pulling the carriages of those who could afford independent transport,<span class="soundcite" data-id="1018394224" data-start="2025" data-end="7456" data-plays="1">footsteps</span>now pound. Hundreds walking freely and without fear of danger beneath the bold pink signs that scream ‘People Make Glasgow’. A message that is best understood along this thoroughfare, where cars have been shunned into the background for the safety of the people.</p>
      <p>It is clear technology has moved on since the 1910s, creating a society that is literally worlds apart from its former self. Not only do cars now drive through the streets of Glasgow without gaining a second look, photos are taken casually without drawing attention. The 20th century static stares of unfamiliarity that have been captured are a stark contrast to the general disinterest of the power we now carry in our pockets. It would be almost impossible to explain how far technology has come to these men in hats who cannot help but stare.</p>
      <p>Buchanan Street has lived through so much history since its earlier days as a high-class haven. The architecture having witnessed more than it can possibly tell. Yet, even though it will forever hold many of its secrets, the street continues to tell us how much it has grown. From its exclusive shopping experience in 1912 to the thriving heart of Glasgow’s style mile, it is clear the street has advanced with the times. Though how it will grow next is anyone’s guess.</p>

      <h2>Fashion Retail and the Coronavirus Pandemic:</h2><h2> The Impact of a Year of Restrictions</h2>
      <p> When the first lockdown was announced over a year ago, all ‘non-essential’ retail was forced to abandon their stock and pull down their shutters in an almost apocalyptic style of events. Streets and cities fell quiet as everyone hid behind closed doors. Cautious of one another. Scared to get too close. Only daring to venture outside for a daily walk, or if they were brave enough, for the weekly shop.</p>
      <p>Yet, while mask, sanitise and social distance is the three-step survival guide that has allowed supermarkets to keep their doors open and generate an income throughout the pandemic, clothing stores have struggled to survive using this guide.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, clothing and department stores have been closed for the duration of three national lockdowns, amounting to around six months of severe measures in which they have been unable to sell clothes. For the six months they have been open, these stores have adhered to the three-steps for survival: customer service smiles have been replaced by the eye scrunch of a masked face, sanitiser stations have been installed in every doorway, and security guards have policed entrances, limiting the number of people in-store.</p>
      <p>However, in following these steps so closely, the well-loved, bustling shopping experience has been sacrificed. The previous ease and excitement of weaving in and out of stores and trying on clothes now complicated by the rules, and the once full-of-life environment a lot weaker than it was before.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, these circumstances have caused clothing sales to decrease dramatically. In 2020, they fell by 25.1%, making fashion the retail sector that has been the worst affected by the UK’s coronavirus restrictions.</p>
      When compared with other retailers, this unwanted classification is clear, as while all retail has generally suffered decreased turnovers, clothing and department stores have been hit the hardest. 81.8% of clothing companies and 100% of department stores reported a decrease in monthly profits in January 2021, representing the only two sectors that did not see any increase in profits.</p>

      <p>Fashion retailers have been teetering on a ledge for most of the pandemic, struggling to regain any balance and stability from the easing of restrictions. As a result, these store’s survival is not inevitable as with every increased restriction and every lockdown, fashion retail is pushed closer to the point of falling, with no possible hope of ever recovering.</p>
      <p>This fatal impact was already hinted at in 2020 when retail titan, Topshop, was forced to permanently close its doors and move its business online after struggling to make a profit and ultimately being bought out by online goliath, ASOS, for £295 million.</p>
      <p>This emulates the trend of the coronavirus pandemic: fashion retailers moving online to cater to the isolated shopper who has become a digital consumer. The shopping experience now predominantly characterised by filtering through nice tops and comfy trousers for those desk-bound days of zoom meetings before staring at the door in anticipation as soon as the dispatch email is sent.
Consumer behaviour has changed massively over the last year, with online retail making up 35.2% of all retail sales in January 2021, compared with 15% the previous year. A significant increase that has allowed online retail to reach a record proportion of total sales.</p>
    <div class="graph">
      <iframe title="Proportion of Sales Occurring Online (in percent)" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-A9e7b" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/A9e7b/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
      </script>
        </div>
      <p>This has been the major plot twist for online fashion retailers as they are now experiencing increased traffic and sales due to shoppers turning to outlets that were not their usual first choice for fashion pre-pandemic. Sales for the Boohoo Group rose by 40% in the last four months of 2020 while sales at ASOS increased by 36%.</p>
      <p>Similarly, traditionally in-store retailers have also experienced this change in consumer behaviour. John Lewis, who had previously gained the majority of their sales from their stores, saw their online sales rise from 40% in March 2020 to 70% in December. This online presence offering the retailer a much-needed lifeline through the consecutive months of lockdown.</p>
      <p>With fashion retail now becoming a digital world, there is no doubt that the pandemic has accelerated and increased the dominance of online fashion retailers. The ease and practicality of browsing and buying clothes online now far too difficult for high street stores to compete with when all they can offer is long-winding queues of unfamiliar masked faces, and restrictions within almost every element of what was previously enjoyed.</p>
      <p>With this ease at the centre of online retail’s appeal, it is unlikely that clothing and department stores will ever be the same again. Abandoned units will be where shoppers’ favourite stores used to, and in-store retailers will have to offer something unique to bait customers away from the convenience of their laptops. If they do not, the classic character of the UK’s high street may be killed off for good, in favour of a more youthful face who will bring the business exactly what it needs.</p>
