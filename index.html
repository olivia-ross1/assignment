      <h2>Buchanan Street Then and Now</h2>
      <iframe frameborder="0" class="juxtapose" width="100%" height="444" src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=93c7b7ba-8d8f-11eb-83c8-ebb5d6f907df"></iframe>
      <p>Between the proudly standing buildings of Glasgow’s past, people flood Buchanan Street from all directions. Colourful plastic bags swinging from their arms as chatter fills the air. These conversations accompanied by the<span class="soundcite" data-id="1018394389" data-start="8103" data-end="25874" data-plays="1">buskers</span>who sing songs from the radio, covering them so well that many can’t help but crowd round them to watch. It may be a busy place. One that is rarely graced by sunlight, but still people come from all over Scotland just to meander along the smooth stoned street, hoping to scout out their next purchase.</p>
      <p>With so much to offer culturally and commercially, and being situated within the city that was voted one of the friendliest in the world, it is no wonder that Buchanan Street has become the central artery of Glasgow’s style mile. A vital part of what is now the second largest retail centre in the UK. Offering access to iconic Scottish born stores like House of Fraser, whilst also catering to the contemporary shopper with global brands like Apple and Nike.</p>
      <p>It is this distinct identity that makes it difficult to imagine Buchanan Street in any other form. Yet, the street we know and love today is strides apart from its early 20th century self. While much of the historic architecture remains, merely having been updated slightly with metal sculptural embellishments, the shops that take up these premises have modernised alongside the consumer.</p>
      <p>In 1912, the entry to Buchanan Street from St. Enoch’s Square was flanked by jewellers. H. Samuel taking up the ground floor of the Arthur & Fraser building on the left corner, and jewellers Robert Scott and Robert Stewart conducting business in the former mansion on the right. All three were a sign of the high-class tone of Buchanan Street in the early 20th century, with Stewart’s premises being particularly upmarket since it offered Glaswegians the opportunity to buy former monarch, Queen Victoria’s appointed goldsmith, silversmith and jeweller.</p>
      <p>Since then, Buchanan Street has made way for contemporary fashion retailers who now dominate much of the street with their vibrant and enticing window displays. Their faceless mannequins decorated in the mass-produced styles of the seasons, encouraging people to buy into the low cost of fashion trends. The variety and quantity of clothes available to the modern Scottish shopper unmatched by the early 20th century, where many people opted to wear the same style. The diversity of fashion only arising when the exclusivity of Glasgow’s style mile significantly reduced.</p>
      <p>Well into 1920s, going to the centre of Glasgow simply to shop was an adventure that many Scots rarely undertook, or could even afford. So, the general increase in incomes and decrease in wealth disparities since then has allowed the street to transform into a place for the many, rather than the few.</p>
      <p>This is perhaps best reflected in the pedestrianisation of the street, as where <span class="soundcite" data-id="1016697784" data-start="5765" data-end="10921" data-plays="1">horses once trotted,</span>pulling the carriages of those who could afford independent transport,<span class="soundcite" data-id="1018394224" data-start="2025" data-end="7456" data-plays="1">footsteps</span>now pound. Hundreds walking freely and without fear of danger beneath the bold pink signs that scream ‘People Make Glasgow’. A message that is best understood along this thoroughfare, where cars have been shunned into the background for the safety of the people.</p>
      <p>It is clear technology has moved on since the 1910s, creating a society that is literally worlds apart from its former self. Not only do cars now drive through the streets of Glasgow without gaining a second look, photos are taken casually without drawing attention. The 20th century static stares of unfamiliarity that have been captured are a stark contrast to the general disinterest of the power we now carry in our pockets. It would be almost impossible to explain how far technology has come to these men in hats who cannot help but stare.</p>
      <p>Buchanan Street has lived through so much history since its earlier days as a high-class haven. The architecture having witnessed more than it can possibly tell. Yet, even though it will forever hold many of its secrets, the street continues to tell us how much it has grown. From its exclusive shopping experience in 1912 to the thriving heart of Glasgow’s style mile, it is clear the street has advanced with the times. Though how it will grow next is anyone’s guess.</p>

      <h2>Fashion Retail and the Coronavirus Pandemic:</h2><h2> The Impact of a Year of Restrictions</h2>
      <p>As the UK sits at home, smiling through endless zoom meetings by day and streaming entire seasons of Netflix shows by night, online shopping has become both a necessity and a tool to fight boredom. Filtering through nice tops and comfy trousers for those desk-bound days at work to then wait in anticipation by the door as soon as the order confirmation email has been sent. The prospect of a package one of the few things that can still be looked forward to.</p>
      <p>Yet, while traffic has increased to the virtual shopping world, only a few trapse past the abandoned store fronts of the UK’s High Street on their daily walks. The coronavirus strangling the last breaths out of an elderly industry.</p>

      <p>This emulates the trend of the coronavirus pandemic: fashion retailers moving online alongside its shoppers who have been forced to become digital consumers due to store closures. Online retail reached a record proportion of total retail, according to the ONS, with 35.2% of all retail sales occurring online in January 2021, compared with 19.5% in January 2020.</p>
